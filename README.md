# CS1520_Final_Project
### Description:
This app is a web application for a simple chatroom app using Flask web development methods. Users can register, which stores their information to a database, sign in, and start chatting using a chat window that utilizes AJAX to quickly update the page. Chats are also stored to the database, and windows using the chat app other than the one that sent the new chat update the chat window within 15 seconds.
### Running:
There are probably several ways to run this, but I suggest to set up a virtual environment, install flask and SQLAlchemy, import the database, and run app.py.
